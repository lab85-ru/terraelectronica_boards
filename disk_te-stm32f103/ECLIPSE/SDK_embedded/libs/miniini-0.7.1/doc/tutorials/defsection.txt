Reading tags before first section


== [DEFAULT] section ==

Sometimes, you might want to have some tags in an ini file before the first
section. And some INI files are so small that they don't need to use sections.
These files contain only tags and no headers. However, MiniINI requires you to
have access to a section to read variables.

In order to support such files, each INIFile contains a section called
**[DEFAULT]** that contains any tags before the first (if any) section.
**Note**: This section is actually called "[DEFAULT]", including brackets. The
reason for this is so that it can't conflict with any existing sections, as
section names can't contain brackets.

Example:
```
    ini.GetSection("[DEFAULT]");
```
