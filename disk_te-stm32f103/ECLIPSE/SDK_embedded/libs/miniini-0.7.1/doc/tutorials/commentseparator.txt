Changing comment and/or tag=value separator character


== Enabling MiniINI logging ==

MiniINI can only handle one comment character, but not all ini files use
semicolon (';') for their comments. Indeed, on Linux/Unix it is common to use
the '#' character for this purpose. Fortunately, it is possible to set which
character is used as the comment character.

To change the comment character, we use the **INISetComment** function. This
function takes one argument, the character to use as the comment character.
INISetComment returns bool that will be true if the character can be used and
was set as the comment character, or false if the character could not be set as
the comment character. (Other characters that have special meanings in an ini
file, such as '[' or '\n' can not be used as the comment character)

Similarly, you can change the character that separates tag names and values in
ini files ('=' by default). You can do this using the **INISetSeparator**
function. This function works in the same way as INISetComment: takes a
character to use as separator, returns true if it was set successfully, or false
if it could not be set.

**NOTE:** INISetComment and INISetSeparator will only affect files opened
**after** they were called!

Example:
```
    INISetComment('#');
    INISetSeparator(':');
```

This will make MiniINI parse anything after a '#' character to the end of line
as a comment (i.e. ignore it) and parse ':' character as a separator between tag
names and values.
