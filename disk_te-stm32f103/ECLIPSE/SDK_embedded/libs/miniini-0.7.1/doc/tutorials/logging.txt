Logging MiniINI warnings


== Enabling MiniINI logging ==

Sometimes it can be useful for users of your program to see what problems are
there in their custom ini files that they can't load. MiniINI provides many 
warnings about incorrect or suspicious ini file data. You can take advantage of
these warnings by enabling MiniINI logging.

Logging in MiniINI works **only** when linking to the debug build 
(libminiini-dbg). It also requires the user to provide a callback function for
MiniINI to call when it has something to log.

== Providing logging callback ==

First, you have to write the callback function. This function must take a const 
pointer to const char (C string) and return nothing. MiniINI logging messages
don't end with a newline, so in order to write logging messages to separate 
lines you have to provide a newline yourself.

Example logging callback function:   
```
void Log(const char * const log)
{
    std::cout << log << std::endl;
}
```

To make MiniINI use this function for logging, you have to pass it using the 
**INILogCallback** function. You can do this in your **main** function or 
anywhere you want to initialize MiniINI:
```
    INILogCallback(Log);
```

You can also change the logging function more than once if you want. That's all 
for this tutorial.
