Compiling MiniINI witout STL


MiniINI was created to be as minimalistic as possible, but sometimes, even that
is not enough. By default, MiniINI includes STL and cotains methods using STL
classes. If you really need absolute minimalism, e.g. for embedded systems, STL
misght be too big for you.

For this reason, MiniINI has an option of disabling all STL functionality.
In order to use MiniINI without STL, you have to compile it using:
```
make no-stl
```
This will compile MiniINI binaries without STL support. You can then install it
as usual using **make install** as root or **sudo make install**.
You also have to define a macro called **INI_NO_STL** before any inclusion if the
MiniINI header, i.e.:
```
#define INI_NO_STL
#include <miniini.h>
```
